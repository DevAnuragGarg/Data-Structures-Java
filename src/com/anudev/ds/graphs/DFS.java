/**
 * Graph: is a pair(V,E), where V is a set of nodes, called vertices and
 * E is a collection of pairs of vertices called edges. There can be
 * directed graph and undirected graphs. Degree of vertex is number of
 * edges incident on it. Applications: 1) Representing relationships
 * between components and electronic circuits. 2) Transportation networks
 * 3) Computer networks 4) Databases: representing dependencies in tables
 * <p>
 * Graph can be represented in Adjacency matrix and Adjacency List.
